Operating Systems Project 4
Leah Plofchan and Brynna Conway

In order to build this program, run the "make" command in our project directory.  From there, you run the program with the following command: "./site-tester config".  The config file contains all of the proper configurations for the successful completion of the program.  If no config file is specified, the program will not run and display a corresponding error message.
